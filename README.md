# IOT-Based-ECG
a cheap ecg device that is enhanced using the IOT technology

The goal of this project is to creat a cheap ecg device that could read (Lead I, Lead II ,and Lead III) from the patient.
The heart rate is measured from the ECG signal and uploaded to an online cloud 
The idea behind the online cloud is to make the patient monitoring more easy for the nurse by logging into a single cloud page and check the condition of the patients simultaneously

chips used in this project:
-ESP3266
-AD8232
-Arduino Uno

also a special modification is done to allow the reading of multiple leads
